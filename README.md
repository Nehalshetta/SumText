# SumText: Text Summarization and Search Engine

This project aims to develop a text summarization and search engine system using deep learning techniques. The system consists of two main components: a text summarization model and a search engine.

The text summarization model is responsible for generating a brief summary of a given text document while preserving its key information. The model is trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on a large corpus of text data. The model's output is a summary that can be used to quickly understand the contents of a large document.

The search engine component is responsible for allowing users to search through a large collection of text documents. The search engine uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user queries and retrieve relevant documents based on their content. The search engine also provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse through the retrieved documents and view their summaries.

This project utilizes various deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to develop a text summarization and search engine. The project is divided into two main components: model development and search engine development. The model development team focuses on training and optimizing the CNN and LSTM models for text summarization. The search engine team works on building a user-friendly search interface that can retrieve summaries based on search queries. The team plans to integrate the model and search engine into a website with a front-end interface and a browser extension. This project showcases advanced machine learning techniques and their application in natural language processing.
